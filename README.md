#Weather prediction test task

## Getting Started

To get you started you can simply clone repository and install the dependencies:


### Clone project

Clone  repository using [git]:

```
git clone https://github.com/OksanaKovalchuk/prediction.git
cd prediction
```
After that you should install npm


### Install Dependencies

We have preconfigured `npm` to automatically run `bower` so we can simply do:
```
run
npm install
```

You should find that you have two new
folders in your project.

* `node_modules` - contains the npm packages for the tools we need
* `app/bower_components` - contains the angular framework files


### Run the Application

The simplest way to start
this server is:

```
npm start
```

Now browse to the app at `http://localhost:8000/`.
